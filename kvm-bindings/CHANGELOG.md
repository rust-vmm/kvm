- Implement `Default` for `kvm_xsave2`, which fixes usage of `Xsave`
  unconditionally causing compile errors in downstream crates.

## v0.8.0

### Added

- An opt-in feature `serde` that enables [`serde`](https://serde.rs)-based
  (de)serialization of various bindings.

## v0.7.0

### Changed
- API change in the bindings from upstream kernel changes:
  * system\_event has been made into a new union
- The x86 module has been renamed to x86\_64 for consistency (matches the kernel
  architecture directory name)
- Added all features to the generated docs.rs documentation.

### Removed

- Dropped "x86" (32-bit) x86 support

## v0.6.0

### Changed

- Updated vmm-sys-utils dependency to 0.11.0

- Added fam-wrapper for the arm specific `kvm_reg_list` struct.

## v0.2.0

### Added

- Added opt-in feature `fam-wrappers` that enables exporting
  safe wrappers over generated structs with flexible array
  members. This optional feature has an external dependency
  on `vmm-sys-util`.
- Added safe fam-wrappers for `kvm_msr_list`, `kvm_msrs`,
  and `kvm_cpuid2`.

## v0.1.1

### Changed
